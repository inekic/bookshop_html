	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Bookshelf is a site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. </p>
	<p>See what books your friends are reading. Track the books you're reading, have read, and want to read. Check out your personalized book recommendations. Our recommendation engine analyzes 20 billion data points to give suggestions tailored to your literary tastes. Find out if a book is a good fit for you from our community’s reviews.</p>
	<p> Reading is fundamental to functioning in today's society. There are many adults who cannot read well enough to understand the instructions on a medicine bottle. That is a scary thought - especially for their children. Filling out applications becomes impossible without help. Reading road or warning signs is difficult. Even following a map becomes a chore. Day-to-day activities that many people take for granted become a source of frustration, anger and fear.</p>
